👋 Hello! I'm Yanxin Peng, currently a sophomore at University of Southern California majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Music Production and Artificial Intelligence.

💡 My passion lies in game development and software engineering. My academic focus includes Game Programming(C++), Software Engineering, Algorithms, 3D molding, and Visual Effects, and I'm always eager to dive into new challenges to advance my skill set.

🎵 Outside of academics, I have a lot of interests, ranging from guitar and piano to gaming and working out, etc. 

🔍 I'm currently seeking internship opportunities in Game Development & Software Engineering.

📩 Feel free to connect or reach out to me for collaboration and job opportunities.
